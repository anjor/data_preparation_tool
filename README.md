# data-preparation-tools

These are a bunch of tools that could be used to prepare data in order to store it on [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io).

They are organised according to the implementation language -- shell scripts are in `bash` etc.

There are a few other tools in the ecosystem which may also be used for data preparation
and might be better suited for the specific circumstances.
